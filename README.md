This repository is where I wil upload my notes for safe keeping as I progress along my learning and certification path.

I am doing this to hold myself accountable for taking an active role during the learning process, and to share my insights with the Network Engineering, Network Automation, Network Development, and NetDevOps communities.

If youâ€™ve come across this repo, feel free to clone, fork, or use the contents within in any way that benefits your work. And of course, contributions and discussion are welcome.

Happy trails!
